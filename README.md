# ktfmt-pre-commit-hook
A [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook to run [ktfmt](https://github.com/facebookincubator/ktfmt).

## Requirements

This commit hook requires Python `>=3.8`.

`ktfmt` requires Java 11. The `java` in your `PATH` must be version `>=11`.

## Usage Instructions

Add the following lines to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/corewar-teamprojekt/ktfmt-pre-commit-hook
  rev: 0.8.0
  hooks:
  - id: ktfmt
    stages: [commit]
```

We use it with the following options:
```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/corewar-teamprojekt/ktfmt-pre-commit-hook
  rev: 0.8.0
  hooks:
  - id: ktfmt
    args: [--dry-run, --kotlinlang-style]
    stages: [commit]
```

With `--dry-run` the hook doesn't automatically format the files on commit.  
With `--kotlinlang-style` the hook uses 4-space indentation instead of 2-space indentation.  

See the [ktfmt documentation](https://facebookincubator.github.io/ktfmt/) for supported command line arguments.

Please report any bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/davehadley/ktfmt-pre-commit-hook/issues).
